counseling typically consists of meeting with your counselor for 60 minutes once every week. you will work with your counselor during that time on the concerns you have presented as a problem for you.  what can i expect in counseling? you can expect to be challenged to think about a different perspective or to make difficult changes. it may be uncomfortable at times due to facing difficult

medication.  im a stafffaculty member and im concerned about a student, what can i do? when you have decided a student might benefit from counseling, it is usually best to express your recommendation in a matteroffact manner. be specific regarding the behavior that has raised your concerns and avoid attributing anything negative to the individual's character. except in an emergency, the option must be left open for the student to accept or refuse counseling. if the student is reluctant for any reason, simply express your acceptance of those feelings so that your relationship with the student is not jeopardized. give the student room to consider alternatives by suggesting that maybe you can talk after the student has had some time to think it over.", "mimetype": "text/plain",
