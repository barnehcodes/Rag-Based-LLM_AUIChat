Query: what are the pip reqs

Response:
The PIP (Presidential Internship Program) requirements include submitting two public documents by the application deadline on May 5th, 2024, 23:59 GMT1. The committee will use cover letters and other application materials to match qualified applicants with the office best suited for their interests, experiences, and skills. Each office will then interview shortlisted candidates via Microsoft Teams before deciding on finalists. Results are communicated by the week of May 20th, 2024, at the latest. Interviews will be conducted by the supervisor of the appropriate internship, a current intern, and the internship program director. If a primary candidate declines an offer, an invitation may be extended to an alternate, at a later date. For more information, you can contact Dr. Cherif Bel Fekih or Mrs. Sanaa Mokaddeme via their provided contact details.
