# Deployment

This directory contains deployment configurations and scripts for the AUIChat application.

## Contents

- **README.md**: This documentation file
- **deploy_vertex.sh**: Script for deploying to Vertex AI
- **deploy_vertex_minimal.sh**: Minimalist deployment script for Vertex AI
- **vertex_tf_test.py**: Test script for Vertex AI deployment
- **vertex_deployment_test.py**: Another test script for Vertex AI deployment

## Overview

The deployment process for AUIChat includes:

1. **Model Deployment**: Deploying models to Vertex AI or other platforms
2. **Infrastructure Provisioning**: Setting up required infrastructure
3. **Configuration Management**: Managing environment-specific configurations
4. **Deployment Verification**: Testing deployed endpoints

## Deployment Options

- **Vertex AI**: Google Cloud's managed ML deployment platform
- **On-premises**: Local deployment using Docker/Kubernetes
- **Hybrid**: Combination of cloud and on-premises deployment

## Deployment Instructions

### Vertex AI Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to Vertex AI with full data processing
./deploy_vertex.sh

# Deploy to Vertex AI with minimal setup (skips data processing)
./deploy_vertex_minimal.sh
```

### Testing the Deployment

```bash
# Run Vertex AI deployment tests
python vertex_deployment_test.py
```

## Next Steps

- Create Cloud Formation/Terraform templates for infrastructure
- Implement blue-green deployment strategy
- Set up automated rollback mechanism
- Create deployment monitoring dashboard
