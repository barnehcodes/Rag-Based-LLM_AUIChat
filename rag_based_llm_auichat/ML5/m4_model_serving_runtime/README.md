# Milestone 4: Model Serving Runtime

This milestone focuses on implementing the runtime environment for hosting and serving the AUIChat model.

## Contents

- Vertex AI integration files
- Model serving scripts
- Performance monitoring

## Runtime Components

1. **Vertex AI Deployment**
   - Model deployment to Google Cloud Vertex AI
   - Endpoint configuration
   - Performance scaling

2. **Inference Optimization**
   - Request batching
   - Caching mechanisms
   - Response optimization

3. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Latency tracking
   - Request/response logging
   - Error handling

## Implementation Status

The Vertex AI deployment has been implemented with the following components:
- `deploy_vertex.sh`: Main deployment script
- `deploy_vertex_minimal.sh`: Simplified deployment approach
- `test_vertex_endpoint.py`: Endpoint testing utility

## Next Steps

- Implement advanced monitoring
- Add auto-scaling capabilities
- Optimize inference performance
