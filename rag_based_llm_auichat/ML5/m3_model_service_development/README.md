# Milestone 3: Model Service Development

This milestone covers the development of the model service layer that handles requests for the AUIChat system.

## Contents

- API service implementation
- Request/response handling logic
- ZenML pipeline integration

## Service Components

The model service layer includes:

1. **API Endpoints**
   - `/chat` for conversation handling
   - `/health` for service health checks
   - `/metrics` for performance monitoring

2. **Pipeline Integration**
   - ZenML step decorators for workflow management
   - Artifact handling
   - Pipeline visualization

3. **Processing Logic**
   - Query preprocessing
   - Vector database retrieval
   - Context augmentation
   - LLM inference

## Implementation Status

Initial implementation of the model service components is underway.

## Next Steps

- Complete the API endpoint definitions
- Finalize request/response formats
- Implement observability hooks
