1. Application and Interview: International students typically apply for a visa through the university's admissions office, which is usually located in a university-designated office. They may take a physical exam, provide letters of recommendation, and meet with course advisors, advisors, or other relevant professionals.
2. Enrolment: Upon admission, students typically take an entrance exam to determine their eligibility for higher education. The first exam is usually held at a university's entrance exam center, which may be a physical exam, a written exam, or a verbal exam.
3. Enrollment Council: Once their entry exam is passed, students attend an enrollment council, which is usually held at a university's admission office. The enrollment council provides guidance on the admission process, including the application deadline, course requirements, and other relevant information.
4. Admission Decision: After completing the enrollment process, students select their highest priority courses and apply to their desired university. They may also choose to complete the required physical exam or take part in a clinical program.
5. Admission Letter: Upon application, applicants submit an admission letter, which outlines their qualifications, curriculum, and academic achievements. The letter is usually written by a university's admissions office or a separate document.
6. Screening: Before admission, applicants may be screened to ensure they meet the university's admission requirements. This may include a language test, a mathematics test, a science test, or a language proficiency test.
7. Placement: After screening, students may be placed on a list of applications or are assigned to a team of students for placement. This is usually based on a student's academic performance, test scores, or other factors.
8. Application Review: The university may request additional documents, such as letters of recommendation, academic transcripts, or test scores, to support the placement.
9. Decision: When the university accepts a student, they receive their acceptance letter and information about the admission process, including their requirements and deadlines.
10. Decision and Follow-up: Once accepted, students will receive a decision letter, which outlines their next steps and contact information. They will also receive follow-up information, including a letter of recommendation, admission materials, and any necessary services or accommodations.

Note: The admission process may vary depending on the university, the student's eligibility, and the university's policies.
