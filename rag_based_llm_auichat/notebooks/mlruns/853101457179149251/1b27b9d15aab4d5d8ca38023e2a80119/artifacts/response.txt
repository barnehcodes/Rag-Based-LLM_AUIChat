**Step 1: Consider the context**
AUI is a college or university. The counseling services you're referring to are the counseling services offered by AUI. If you're looking for counseling services for students or employees, you might be looking for the services offered by the university's student counseling center or the university's employee assistance program (EAP).

**Step 2: Identify the target audience**
Who do you want to ask? Are you looking for students, employees, or both? This will help you tailor your response and the specific services you'll offer.

**Step 3: Ask in a direct question**
You can ask your question in a clear and direct manner. Avoid using vague phrases like "I need a counseling service." Instead, ask "Are there counseling services available at the [AUI]?"

**Step 4: Be prepared to provide information**
Be ready to provide the specific services you're looking for. You might need to provide some information about what you're looking for, such as the type of counseling services offered, the size of the counseling team, or the number of students or employees served.
