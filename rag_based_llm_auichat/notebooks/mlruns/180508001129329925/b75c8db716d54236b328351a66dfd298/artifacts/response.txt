The PiP program requires applicants to be recent graduates of a university that follows the American style liberal arts model. They must also speak English fluently. Additionally, it's noted that the program welcomes applications from candidates of all nationalities and citizenship statuses with US-style, liberal arts undergraduate degrees.
