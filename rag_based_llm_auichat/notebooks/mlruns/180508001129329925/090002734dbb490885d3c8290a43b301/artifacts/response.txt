The PiP program requires applicants to have recently graduated with an undergraduate degree within the last two academic years (fall-winter 2022-23 or later). Additionally, letters from faculty or university administrators who know the applicant well are especially helpful. While proficiency in French or Arabic is encouraged and appreciated, it is not necessary. The student's general qualifications, middle eastern or African experience or interest, and ability to serve in the specific internships should also be identified in the recommendation letter.
