The requirements for the PiP program include being a recent graduate, familiar with the American style liberal arts model, fluent in English, and having recently graduated with an undergraduate degree within the last two academic years. Proficiency in French or Arabic is encouraged but not necessary. The application process involves filling out an application form and submitting a short essay, along with other documents. The essay should discuss the applicant's interest in the AUI internship program, any special skills, talents, or experiences that would help the candidate contribute to the positions and to the AUI community, and any special interest or experience the candidate has in Morocco and in the broader MENA region. For applicants whose first language is not English, taking the TOEFL exam for English competency is required.
