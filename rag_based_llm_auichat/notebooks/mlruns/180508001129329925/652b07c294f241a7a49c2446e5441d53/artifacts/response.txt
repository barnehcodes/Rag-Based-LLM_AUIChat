The PiP program requires applicants to submit a cover letter, resume, and two letters of recommendation from faculty members, administrators, or work supervisors. The letters of recommendation should identify the student's general qualifications, middle eastern or African experience or interest, and ability to serve in the specific internships. The committee will use these materials to match qualified applicants with the office best suited for their interests, experiences, and skills. Shortlisted candidates will then be interviewed via Microsoft Teams, and the final decision will be made after reconvening.
