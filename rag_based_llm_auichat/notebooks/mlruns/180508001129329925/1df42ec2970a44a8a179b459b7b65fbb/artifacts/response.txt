The PiP program requires applicants to be recent graduates of the American style liberal arts model. They must speak English fluently, and proficiency in French or Arabic is encouraged but not necessary. Applicants must have recently graduated with an undergraduate degree within the last two academic years (fall-winter 2022-23 or later). The program welcomes applications from candidates of all nationalities and citizenship statuses who have US-style, liberal arts undergraduate degrees. However, priority is given to non-Moroccan nationals. It's important to note that students who have completed their entire undergraduate education in Morocco are not eligible to apply. Previous interns have arrived with varying levels of Arabic and French knowledge, from native level fluency to no experience at all.
