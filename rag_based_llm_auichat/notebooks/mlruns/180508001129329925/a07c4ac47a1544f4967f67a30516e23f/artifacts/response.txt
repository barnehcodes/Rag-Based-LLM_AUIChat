The PiP program requires applicants to be recent graduates of an American style liberal arts model. They must speak English fluently, and proficiency in French or Arabic is encouraged but not necessary. Applicants must have recently graduated with an undergraduate degree within the last two academic years (fall-winter 2022-23 or later). The application process involves filling out an application form, submitting a short essay, an updated CV, and a letter addressed to the president of AUI, Dr. Amine Bensaid, specifying the candidate's top three internship choices ranked in order of preference.
