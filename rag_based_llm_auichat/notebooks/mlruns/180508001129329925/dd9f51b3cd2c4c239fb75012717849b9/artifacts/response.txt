The PiP program requires applicants to be recent graduates of an American-style liberal arts model. They must speak English fluently and have recently graduated with an undergraduate degree within the last two academic years. Proficiency in French or Arabic is encouraged but not necessary. Applicants should fill out an application form, submit a short essay, an updated CV, and a letter specifying their top three internship choices ranked in order of preference. Prior study of Arabic and French is useful but not required. The program welcomes applications from candidates of all nationalities and citizenship statuses who have US-style, liberal arts undergraduate degrees, but priority will be given to non-Moroccan nationals. Students who have completed their entire undergraduate education in Morocco are not eligible to apply.
