The PiP program requires applicants to be recent graduates of the American style liberal arts model, speak English fluently, and have recently graduated with an undergraduate degree within the last two academic years. Proficiency in French or Arabic is encouraged but not necessary. The program welcomes applications from candidates of all nationalities and citizenship statuses who have US-style, liberal arts undergraduate degrees. However, priority will be given to non-Moroccan nationals. It's important to note that students who have completed their entire undergraduate education in Morocco are not eligible to apply. The level of Arabic and French knowledge among previous interns has varied significantly, from native level fluency to no experience at all.
