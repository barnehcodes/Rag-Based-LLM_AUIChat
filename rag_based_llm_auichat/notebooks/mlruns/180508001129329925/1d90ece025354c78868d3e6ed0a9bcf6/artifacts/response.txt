The PiP program requires applicants to be recent graduates of the American style liberal arts model, speak English fluently, and have recently graduated with an undergraduate degree within the last two academic years. Proficiency in French or Arabic is encouraged but not necessary. Applicants should note that priority will be given to non-Moroccan nationals, and students who have completed their entire undergraduate education in Morocco are not eligible to apply. The contact information for the program is available, with Dr. Cherif Bel Fekih as the Director and Dr. Sanaa Mokaddeme as the Manager of the Office of the President.
