The PiP program requires applicants to be recent graduates of an American-style liberal arts model. They must also speak English fluently. Additionally, while the program welcomes applications from candidates of all nationalities and citizenship statuses with US-style, liberal arts undergraduate degrees, priority is given to non-Moroccan nationals.
