The PiP program requires applicants to be recent graduates of an American-style liberal arts model. They must speak English fluently and have recently graduated with an undergraduate degree within the last two academic years. Proficiency in French or Arabic is encouraged but not necessary. Applicants should submit an application form, a short essay, an updated CV, a letter to the president of AUI, and two letters of recommendation from faculty members, administrators, or work supervisors. The essay should discuss the candidate's interest in the AUI internship program, any special skills, talents, or experiences that would help them contribute to the positions and the AUI community, and any special interest or experience the candidate has in Morocco and the broader MENA region. The essay should be limited to 750 words. The letters of recommendation should be submitted directly to oireaui.ma.
