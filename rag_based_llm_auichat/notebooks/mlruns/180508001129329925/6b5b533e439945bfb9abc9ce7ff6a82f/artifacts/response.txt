The PiP program requires applicants to be recent graduates of the American style liberal arts model, speak English fluently, and have recently graduated with an undergraduate degree within the last two academic years. Proficiency in French or Arabic is encouraged but not necessary. Applicants should also submit an application form, a short essay, an updated CV, and a letter specifying their top three internship choices ranked in order of preference.
