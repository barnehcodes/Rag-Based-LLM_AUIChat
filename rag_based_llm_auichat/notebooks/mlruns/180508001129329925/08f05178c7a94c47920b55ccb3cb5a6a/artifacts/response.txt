The requirements for the PiP program include being a recent graduate, familiar with the American style liberal arts model, fluent in English, and having recently graduated with an undergraduate degree within the last two academic years. Proficiency in French or Arabic is encouraged but not necessary. The application process involves filling out an application form and submitting a short essay, limited to 750 words, discussing the candidate's interest in the AUI internship program, special skills, talents, or experiences, and any special interest or experience in Morocco and the broader MENA region. For applicants whose first language is not English, taking the TOEFL exam for English competency is required.
