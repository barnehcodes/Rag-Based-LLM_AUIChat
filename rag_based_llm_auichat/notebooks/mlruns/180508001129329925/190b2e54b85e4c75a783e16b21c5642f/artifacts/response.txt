The PiP program requires applicants to be recent graduates of an American-style liberal arts model. They must speak English fluently, and proficiency in French or Arabic is encouraged but not necessary. Applicants must have recently graduated with an undergraduate degree within the last two academic years. The application process involves filling out an application form and submitting a short essay, a limit of 750 words, discussing the candidate's interest in the AUI internship program, special skills, talents, or experiences, and any special interest or experience in Morocco and the broader MENA region. The application deadline is May 5th, 2024, at 23:59 GMT+1. The committee will use the cover letters and other application materials to match qualified applicants with the office best suited for their interests, experiences, and skills. Interviews will be conducted via Microsoft Teams, and results will be communicated by the week of May 20th, 2024, at the latest.
