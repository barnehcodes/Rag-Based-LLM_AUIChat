The PiP program requires applicants to be recent graduates of an American-style liberal arts model. They must speak English fluently and have recently graduated with an undergraduate degree within the last two academic years. Proficiency in French or Arabic is encouraged but not necessary. Applicants should submit an application form along with a short essay, limited to 750 words, discussing their interest in the program, special skills, talents, or experiences, and any special interest or experience they have in Morocco and the broader MENA region. The application deadline is May 5th, 2024, 23:59 GMT+1. Non-Moroccan nationals are given priority, but candidates from all nationalities and citizenship statuses who have US-style, liberal arts undergraduate degrees are welcome to apply.
