The PiP program requires applicants to be recent graduates of the American style liberal arts model, speak English fluently, and have recently graduated with an undergraduate degree within the last two academic years (fall-winter 2022-23 or later). Proficiency in French or Arabic is encouraged but not necessary. Applicants must also be familiar with the American style liberal arts model. The program welcomes applications from candidates of all nationalities and citizenship statuses who have US-style, liberal arts undergraduate degrees, but priority will be given to non-Moroccan nationals. Please note that students who have completed their entire undergraduate education in Morocco are not eligible to apply.
